So, 2018 is almost over and I thought it would be nice to reflect on the books I've read during the year. 


2018
-----------------
- "The Coaching Habit", by Michael Bungay Stanier 
It's a good book. I feel that it's a little longer than needed, but has some good advice. My key takeaway is that when coaching you should be asking the good questions instead of trying to answer them.

- "Silo", by Hugh Howey:
A series of 3 post-apocalyptic science fiction books:
  *	Wool
  *	Shift
  *	Dust
I really enjoyed the first book of the series, but Shift and Wool weren't as good. 
I would still recommend reading all of them to any scify fan.

- "The Fifth Season", by N. K. Jemisin
Awesome science fiction novel. I'm looking forward to reading the rest of the "Broken Earth" books.

- "Programming beyond practices: be more than just a code monkey", by Gregory Brown
Not as good as I expected. I would recommend this book to a junior developer.

- "It Doesn't have to be crazy at work", by Jason Fried and David Heinemeier Hansson
I love DHH and JF books, they are short and to the point. 
"It Doesn't have to be crazy at work" has lots of what should be common sense advice but that we, as an industry, need to reflect and start making changes. I love the idea of a calm work environment and I will certanly start applying some of the tips from the book.

- "Love in the Time of Cholera", by Gabriel García Márquez.
This is the sencond time that I read this book. It's still amazing. If you haven´t read it yet, I higly recommend it.


So, there it is. Not as many as I would have liked, but not too bad given that is my first year as a parent :)
