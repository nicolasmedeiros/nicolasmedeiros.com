I'm Nicol√°s, a Computer Engineer from Montevideo, Uruguay. I have 15+ years of practical experience with full stack engineering, working with web technologies since befora AJAX was a thing. I have taken projects from idea to production, working on architecture, frontend and backend development while leading agile teams. 

Husband, father of a toddler, scyfi junky -being Isaac Asimov's Fundation my all time number one- and early morning runner.
